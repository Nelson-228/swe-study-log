# Day 4 â€“ Loops

This folder contains two practice scripts to demonstrate `for` and `while` loops in Python.

## ðŸ“„ Scripts

### `for_practice.py`  
Uses a `for` loop to calculate total time needed to complete a user-specified number of tasks (homework). Demonstrates loop over a fixed range.

### `while_practice.py`  
Uses a `while` loop to count from 1 to a user-entered number. Demonstrates loop execution until a condition becomes false.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- `for` loops: best when iterating a known number of times (`range()`)
- `while` loops: best for loops that run until a condition fails
- How to update counters to avoid infinite loops
- Practical logic modeling for time estimation and sequential counting

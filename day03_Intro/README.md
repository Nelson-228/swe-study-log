## ✅ Day 3: Python Conditionals

**Filename:** `day3_conditionals.py`  
**Topic:** If / Elif / Else logic  
**Description:**  
A command-line script that:
- Asks the user for their name
- Takes a numeric test score (0–100)
- Outputs a letter grade (A–F) using conditional statements
- Provides motivational feedback based on score range

**Concepts practiced:**
- User input handling
- Data type casting (`input()` to `float`)
- Multi-branch control flow using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- String formatting with `f-strings`

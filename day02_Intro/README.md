# Day 2 – Python Variables & Math

This folder contains a practice script for Python variables, arithmetic, and user input/output.

## Script: `day2_math.py`

**Goal:**  
Allow the user to input two numbers and perform a basic arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) based on user-selected input.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Declaring and initializing variables
- Receiving user input with `input()`
- Type conversion with `float()`
- Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- `if/elif/else` branching for operator selection
- Graceful handling of invalid input

# Day 1 – Python Intro & Input/Output

This script marks the beginning of my SWE Study Log — a structured, day-by-day effort to build foundational Python and software engineering skills in preparation for top-tier internship applications.

## 📄 Script: `day1_basics.py`

### 🌟 Goal
Practice Python syntax and user interaction through simple I/O and arithmetic.

### ✅ What It Does
- Greets the user by name using `input()`
- Prompts for two integers
- Outputs the sum using formatted string output

### 🔍 Concepts Practiced
- `input()` function for user interaction
- `int()` for type conversion
- `f-string` formatting
- Arithmetic operators (`+`)
- Script readability through clean structure and inline comments

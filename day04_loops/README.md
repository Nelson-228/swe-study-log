# Day 4 â€“ Loops

This folder contains practice scripts for Python `for` and `while` loops.

## `loops_practice.py`

Uses a `for` loop to calculate the total estimated time needed to complete a user-specified number of tasks (homework). Demonstrates loop over a known number of iterations.

## `while_practice.py`

Uses a `while` loop to count from 1 to a user-entered number. Demonstrates loop over an unknown number of iterations until a condition becomes false.

## Key Learnings:
- `for` loops: best for known iteration counts (`range()`)
- `while` loops: best when looping until a condition is no longer true
- How to avoid infinite loops by updating counters
